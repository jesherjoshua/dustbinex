## Dustbinex

Dustbinex is a smart dustbin that utilizes cutting-edge computer vision technology to segregate waste automatically. The dustbin is equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that detect the type of waste being disposed of and segregates it into separate compartments.

### Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x

### How to use Dustbinex

1. Ensure that the dustbin is connected to a power source and is turned on.
2. Dispose of waste into the dustbin.
3. Dustbinex will automatically detect the type of waste and segregate it into separate compartments.

### Development

Dustbinex is built on TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning library. The computer vision model used in Dustbinex is trained using a large dataset of images of different types of waste.

### Future Work

Dustbinex is an ongoing project, and we are constantly working to improve its performance and add new features. In the future, we plan to integrate Dustbinex with cloud-based analytics platforms to provide users with real-time insights into their waste disposal habits.

### Contributors

Dustbinex is developed and maintained by a team of passionate engineers at VIT Chennai. We welcome contributions from the community and are committed to making Dustbinex a powerful tool for waste management.
